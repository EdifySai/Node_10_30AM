Express.js: 

It is a server side javascript framework which is used to develop restful web services. 

To use express, we need to install express from npmjs. 

command: npm i express. 

Since the webservices are served through http protocol, hence we need to understand http prootocol.

1. get  - to get the data
2. post  - to post the data
3. delete - to delete data 
4. put - to update the data
